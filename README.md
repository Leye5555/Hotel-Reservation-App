# Hotel-Reservation-App
This is a command line app for making hotel reservations.
It tracks all available rooms, occupied rooms and paid/free rooms.
It ensures users cannot book already taken rooms within the same time frame.
To use the app, clone the repo and open using Intellij or any Java environment tool.
